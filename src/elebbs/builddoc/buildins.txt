EleBBS v0.11.b1
===============

Building EleBBS is rather straightforward. All needed sources are, well -
should be, under the main source directory. You also need AsyncPro for DOS to
compile the whole of the EleBBS source tree, although there is work in progress
to seperate this completely.

You should install FreePascal which is available for download at
www.freepascal.org. Currently i use an 1.1 version of this compiler but
building using FreePascal 1.0.6 should work too.

You also need EleCOM, and you might want to install it in C:\elecom\src\.

Assuming you installed the EleBBS source under "C:\BBS\SRC\", you could create
two simple files, defining the unit search and includefile search directories
for FreePascal, you could something like this:

--units.lst--
-Fuc:\elecom\src;
-Fuc:\bbs\src;
-Fuc:\apro;
-Fuc:\bbs\src\mkmsg\;
-Fuc:\bbs\src\32bit;
-Fuc:\bbs\src\gencfg\;
-Fuc:\bbs\src\csys\;
-Fuc:\bbs\src\inet\source\;
-Fuc:\bbs\src\cgi\;
-Fuc:\bbs\src\mysql\;
-Fuc:\bbs\src\elexer\;
----

and:

--incls.lst--
-Fic:\bbs\src;
-Fic:\apro;
-Fic:\bbs\src\mkmsg\;
-Fic:\bbs\src\dummy\dos;
-Fic:\bbs\src\mkmsg;
-Fic:\bbs\src\32bit;
-Fic:\bbs\src\gencfg\;
-Fic:\elecom\src\;
-FiC:\bbs\src\baseinc\;
----

Put these two include files in the same directory as your FreePascal compiler.
If you installed EleBBS in any other directory, you need to change it. Building
EleBBS from there on is pretty straightforward, just open COMPILER.INC and
read the instructions in there. It pretty much explains how to setup different
settings for different programs.

After that, you can build EleBBS for example by using:

ppc386 c:\bbs\src\elebbs -B @units.lst @incls.lst -Sd

That should give you a working EleBBS.

Maarten Bekers.
