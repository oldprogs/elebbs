EleWEB hints
------------

There are several things you can do to enhance this EleWEB further. I'll try
to list some possibilities below which I hope to implement into EleWEB sooner
or later. If you implement any of these yourselve please let me know!


Personalized menus
------------------
By setting cookies or using the user-extension file you can create customized
menus which are completely skinned or just give the user a color scheme to
pick from.


User information
----------------
You could extent the user-list page with a link to the user that contain some
information about the user. By using the user-extension file you can even
show a picture of the user which the user should be able to upload himself.


Creating user homepages
-----------------------
You can dedicate some diskspace to users (in their home directory as specified
by the user extension file) and let them manage that part themselves. That way
you could give users the possibility to create their own homepages.


Searching for keywords in the filebase
--------------------------------------
You could create a script that lets user seach for keywords in the filebase.


Dynamic DNS hosting
-------------------
You could allow your users to have a dynamic IP address which is linked to
your domainname. This would require some help of external programs though
(especially a DNS server ;-)
